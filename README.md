# Laws-of-Motion
A demo where an object makes use of position, velocity, and acceleration, to move around the window.

Firstly, the console window and buffer width need to coincide (no horizontal scrolling).
Then, the console can be resized at will, to set the stage for the program.
Once a key is pressed, the program uses the console sizes it finds at that moment, and the main part starts.
A rectangle should be visible in the middle of the console, which can be moved around using the arrow keys.
On the last line of the console, stats will be displayed (acceleration, velocity, position).
Pressing the escape key will end the program.
